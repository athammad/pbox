**Comments for CRAN Submission**

**Package:** `pbox`

**Version:** 0.1.7.9000

**Title:** Exploring Multivariate Spaces with Probability Boxes

**Authors:** Ahmed T. Hammad ([ahmed.t.hammad\@gmail.com](mailto:ahmed.t.hammad@gmail.com){.email})

# Summary

The `pbox` package facilitates probabilistic modeling and scenario analysis using Probability Boxes (p-boxes).
It provides a comprehensive set of tools for constructing, querying, and analyzing p-box objects, which encapsulate the uncertainty and dependencies in multivariate data.
The package is particularly useful for applications requiring detailed uncertainty quantification and probabilistic reasoning, such as risk assessment and decision analysis.

# Key Features

-   Automated Distribution and Copula Selection: Automatically selects the best marginal distributions and copula models for a given dataset, simplifying the modeling process.

-   Flexible Querying: Supports complex queries on the probabilistic space of p-box objects, including marginal, joint, and conditional distributions.

-   Scenario Analysis: Enables detailed scenario analysis by perturbing underlying parameters and assessing the impact on probabilistic outcomes.

-   Confidence Intervals: Optionally estimates confidence intervals through bootstrapping, providing robust uncertainty quantification.

# Major Functions

-   `set_pbox()`: Constructs a `pbox` object from a dataset by selecting the best marginal distributions and copula.

-   `qpbox()`: Queries the probabilistic space of a `pbox`object, supporting marginal, joint, and conditional probability calculations.
    `grid_pbox()`: Performs a grid search to explore the probabilistic space over a grid of values.

-   `scenario_pbox()`: Performs scenario analysis by modifying underlying parameters of a `pbox` object.

    Testing and Quality Assurance Comprehensive unit tests are included, covering various input scenarios and edge cases to ensure the robustness and reliability of the package functions.

The package has been checked using `R CMD check --as-cran` and passes all tests without errors or warnings.

# Additional Information

## Vignette

A detailed vignette is provided to demonstrate the main functionalities of the package, including data preparation, visualization, probabilistic querying, and scenario analysis.
Dependencies: The package depends on several well-known and actively maintained R packages, including `data.tabl`e, `ggplot2`, `copula`, `gamlss`, and `gamlss.dist`.

## Submission Notes

This is the initial submission of the `pbox` package to CRAN.

The package follows CRAN policies and guidelines, including proper documentation, testing, and dependency management.
I am committed to maintaining and updating the package based on user feedback and CRAN policies.
Thank you for considering the `pbox` package for inclusion in CRAN.
I look forward to your feedback and I am happy to make any necessary adjustments to meet CRAN standards.
After being accepted as part of CRAN, I will submit a detailed paper to the *Journal of Statistical Software*, where I will discuss the mathematical background, the key features, and provide an application of the library, along with a discussion of potential future improvements."
