\title{Create a Probability Box from Data}
\usage{
set_pbox(data, verbose = TRUE, type = "all", family = "all", ...)

\S4method{set_pbox}{ANY}(data, verbose = TRUE, type = "all", family = "all", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or data table. The data will be coerced to a `data.table` internally.}

\item{verbose}{control verbosity of the output. Default to TRUE.}

\item{type}{Charter indicating the type of copula among archmCopula,evCopula,ellipCopula.}

\item{...}{Other arguments to be passed to the `fitDist` function.}

\item{familly}{Charter indicating the family of copula among clayton,frank,gumbel,joe,galambos, huslerReiss, normal.}
}
\value{
An object of class `pbox` with the following slots:
        - `@data`: The original data coerced into a `data.table`.
        - `@copula`: The selected copula object, typically of class `mvdc`.
        - `@fit`: A list containing results from the automated selection processes for
          both the marginal distributions and the copula.
}
\description{
Constructs a probability box (pbox) by automatically selecting the best marginal distribution
and copula for a given dataset. This function facilitates the creation of a pbox object,
which encapsulates the uncertainty and dependencies of the input data.

`set_pbox` method that utilizes data frames or data tables to configure a comprehensive
pbox structure. The method involves stages of distribution fitting and copula selection,
executed through external functions presumed to be available in the working environment
or described in the package.

  data("SEAex")
