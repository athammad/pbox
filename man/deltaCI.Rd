\usage{
deltaCI(cond)

\S4method{deltaCI}{ANY}(cond)
}
\arguments{
\item{cond}{list with the result of the perturbed probability for `mj` and `co` and correspondent CI.}
}
\value{
The Confidence Interval for the conditional probability.

Numeric vector representing the computed probability and confidence intervals using the perturbed copula and delta method.

\description{
Internal method to compute the probability using delta method which approximates
the variance of a function of random variables (in this case, the ratio) based on the variance of the original estimates.

`deltaCI` general method.
Internal method to compute the probability using delta method which approximates
the variance of a function of random variables (in this case, the ratio) based on the variance of the original estimates.
